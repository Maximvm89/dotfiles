# Framestore Network Jumping with Favorites
# -----------------------------------------
# If you have DMX priviledges, this will enable you to directly
# ssh across content zone networks.
# Usage:
#  ssh <host>.<site>[.<network>]
# Examples:
#  ssh hotel.ldn.vfx
#  ssh dm.nyc.ia
#  ssh sys21.ldn
# !! Note that not specifying the network will always take you
#    to the shared network for that site, regardless of what
#    network you are already in. !!
# !! Please update the ProxyCommand dmx lines to your local site. !!
# Favorites can be added with the shortcut name at the end
#  of the first Host line for each Desination section, and
#  appending the site-included hostname routing to the section
#  like with sys1980 below.
# ProxyCommand is used over ProxyJump while some machines are still SL6

# Jump through the local dmx to get to remote dmx's.
